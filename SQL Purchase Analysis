The following queries are used to obtain and maniupulate customer and purchase information from related tables.

#1
The following code uses four related tables to calculate revenue and join it with artist and genre information for a desired time frame. 

SELECT  ROUND(Invoice_items.UnitPrice * SUM(invoice_items.Quantity),2) AS Revenue ,genres.Name AS Genre, tracks.Composer,
CASE
WHEN InvoiceDate like '%2010%'
THEN '2010'
WHEN InvoiceDate like '%2009%'
THEN '2009'
WHEN InvoiceDate like '%2008%'
THEN '2008'
WHEN InvoiceDate like '%2007%'
THEN '2007'
WHEN InvoiceDate like '%2006%'
THEN '2006'
WHEN InvoiceDate like '%2005%'
THEN '2005'
ELSE 'Before 2005'
END AS "YearSold"
FROM chinook.invoice_items
INNER JOIN chinook.tracks
ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.Trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices
